        For centuries, women have pushed their limits in the mountains. For
        nearly as long, they’ve done so behind the scenes and rarely received
        proper credit, being recorded as “Sir William’s Wife” or left unnamed.
        And when a woman did summit, it wasn’t due to her own strength but—as
        the narrative often went—to the men on her team who surely carried her
        across crevasses, hauled her pack, and held her hand on the most daring
        precipices. Women have persisted, though. Since women were recorded in
        mountaineering in the late eighteenth century, to the first 5.15 female
        ascent by Margo Hayes in 2017, the call of the mountains has been as
        strong for women as it has been for men.
